# Datathon-Fall-2022

Used R's data.table, quantmod, ggplot2, aplpack, psych, plotly, rpart, and corrplot libraries to identify trends from Bitcoin and Ethereum price data. This project will give investors insight as crypto's price fluctuations are far more ambiguous than equity/fixed income investments

Data is manipulated and visualized throughout to show which months have been the most successful for trading both tokens, which investment intervals have been the most fruitful, and quantify volatility for different types of traders among other things.

Findings are summarized with embedded comments throughout the file and a final summary is given at the end.
